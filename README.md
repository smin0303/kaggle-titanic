# kaggle-titanic

An introductory competition from Kaggle using data from the Titanic Disaster. More can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

"The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck."

The goal is to create an ML model using train.csv to predict the survival outcome of the passengers in test.csv. Since it is a competition, the submission will be scored based on how many passengers' survival the model was able to correctly predict. There is a rolling leaderboard with a 2 month time limit.
